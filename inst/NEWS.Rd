        \itemize{
            \item In calls to BLAS and LAPACK, we now use the same new
                macros that \code{R} uses in its code (\code{FCONE},
                \code{FC_LEN_T}, and \code{USE_FC_LEN_T}) since version 3.6.2.
                This approach is recommended in Writing R Extensions, see
                Chapter 6.6.1.

    \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
        \itemize{
            \item fixed variadic macro ##__VA_ARGS__ because it is not
                portable (clang complains)
            \item fixed implicit type conversion of function 'med3' (only
                detected by clang on Apple M1), now int return type
            \item OpenMP issue: 'omp_set_num_threads' is now guarded by a
                conditional compilation directive
            \item OpenMP issue: removed '#pragma omp simd' directive in
                wbacon.c (line 480) because the optimizer was unable to
                perform the vectorization
